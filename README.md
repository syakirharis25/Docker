## 1. Introduction.

Docker is an open source containerization platform. Docker enables developers to package applications into containers—standardized executable components that combine application source code with all the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run the code in any environment.
<br /><br />
While developers can create containers without Docker, Docker makes it easier, simpler, and safer to build, deploy, and manage containers. It’s essentially a toolkit that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update, and stop containers using simple commands and work-saving automation.
<br /><br />
Docker also refers to Docker, Inc., the company that sells the commercial version of Docker, and to the Docker open source project, to which Docker Inc. and many other organizations and individuals contribute.
<br /><br />
Docker Inc. was founded by Solomon Hykes and Sebastien Pahl during the Y Combinator Summer 2010 startup incubator group and launched in 2011. Hykes started the Docker project in France as an internal project within dotCloud, a platform-as-a-service company.
<br /><br />
Docker debuted to the public in Santa Clara at PyCon in 2013. It was released as open-source in March 2013. At the time, it used LXC as its default execution environment. One year later, with the release of version 0.9, Docker replaced LXC with its own component, which was written in the Go programming language.
